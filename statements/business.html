            <p><strong>1. </strong>To develop a cost effective system and efficient systems that recovers the energy lost in braking</p>

            <p>Background: Generally when we apply brakes a huge amount of energy is lost due to frictional resistance between ground and the tyres. Challenge is to develop a system that can utilize this lost energy in order to charge a cell. It should be easily fitted to the vehicle so as to charge the cell. This cell should not primary cell. It should be an additional cell storing energy.</p>

            <p><strong>2. </strong>Delay or inability of a woman in urban areas (Tier I/ II cities) to inform relevant persons in real time of a situation that results or is likely to result in an act of sexual abuse/ violence.

            </p>

            <p>Background: Safety of Women from sexual assualt and other incidents of sexual violence is an unrelenting and increasingly frequent problem in modern Indian cities. Urban areas have opened up new employment opportunities for women which has also led to a increasing number of working women in urban areas; many of whom are new migrants to these cities and without local presence of family. Urban areas also see an increased interaction of women and men in workspaces, in transit (buses, trains, cabs, Uber, Ola etc.) and other public spaces; and during all times of the day and night. 

              When a women is in a situation where she is alone and vulnerable to incidents of sexual assault, it is important that she is able to inform her friends and family of the situation immediately, without any delay and on a real-time basis so that help can arrive quickly. The now ubiquitous smart-phone, although seemingly a woman's closest ally in such times still does not offer a comprehensive solution by which a woman in distress can relay SOS-type information to a pre-determined set of people effectively and in real-time with necessary details such as location and the details of the situation that she is in. This would help the relevant persons to effectively and quickly respond to the crisis. 
              
              
             <br><br>Solutions Expected: 
            <li>The solution can be smart-phone based since it is a device that most urban women carry; but this itself need not rule out a separate/ exclusive device for the solution</li>
            <li>The woman must be able to send out the alert quickly and in any situation of sexual assault/ violence (it is likely that she may not be able to access the device for more than a few seconds or possibly cannot accesss it physically at all)</li>
            <li>The solution should be wary of itself turning into a privacy concern</li>

          <!-- Marketing Of Agri-Commodities: Implementing seamless marketing of agri commodities beyond the current geographic  array.
Background: Government Of India aimed to accomplish this through the eNAM but most trades on eNAM are only intra mandi trades.. eNAM, which was envisioned as a unified national electronics agriculture market, faces multiple hurdles. Grading and contentment are demanding if marketing of agriculture trades has to start happening between mandis that are far apart. Government data show that the six States with the most mandis under eNAM are Uttar Pradesh – 66; Madhya Pradesh – 58; Haryana: 54; Maharashtra – 54; Telangana – 44 and Gujarat – 40. But the platform is not fully functional in any State. There are no scientific sorting/grading facilities or quality testing machines. Lack of internet connectivity is another issue impeding progress.
The Requirements: Technology endorsed solutions to enable marketing of various agri-commodities among  mandis of different states. -->
